### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ewardling/ewardling** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my PhD in Applied Linguistics at Ball State University.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently researching language and gender.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about gender, language, pronouns, or bluegrass music.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: etward@bsu.edu
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his or they/them/their
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also play banjo in a bluegrass band, Audie Blaylock and Redline.
